# Database Config Builder for Kofax RPA

This app is created to be used for RPA projects at de Volksbank using an OTAP pipeline.

The application generates a query string for use in the Kofax RPA `Select from Database` action and a config to create an appropriate MSSQL database table. It also creates a hash code that can be used to share the configuration and reduce resource files in projects.
